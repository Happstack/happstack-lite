In this example, we demonstrate how to get starting with a simple, little web application.

First we need some LANGUAGE pragmas:

> {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings, ScopedTypeVariables #-}
> module Main where

And then we have some imports:

> import Control.Applicative ((<$>), optional)
> import Data.Maybe (fromMaybe)
> import Data.Text (Text)
> import Data.Text.Lazy (unpack)
> import Happstack.Lite
> import Text.Blaze
> import Text.Blaze.Html5           
> import Text.Blaze.Html5.Attributes (action, enctype, href, name, size, type_, value)
> import qualified Text.Blaze.Html5 as H
> import qualified Text.Blaze.Html5.Attributes as A

To start the app we just call the 'serve' function. The first argument
is an optional configuration parameter. The second argument is our web
application:

> main :: IO ()
> main = serve Nothing myApp

A web application has the type 'ServerPart Response'. 'ServerPart' is a web serving monad. Happstack provides a bunch of functions which run in the 'ServerPart' monad. You can think of it as the web equivalent of the 'IO' monad. Here is our web application:

> myApp :: ServerPart Response
> myApp = msum
>   [ dir "echo"    $ echo
>   , dir "query"   $ queryParams
>   , dir "form"    $ formPage
>   , dir "fortune" $ fortune
>   , dir "files"   $ fileServing
>   , dir "upload"  $ upload
>   , homePage
>   ]

This web application has two routes. 

Since this is a web application, we are going to want to create some HTML pages. We will do that using blaze-html. A blaze tutorial can be found here:

http://jaspervdj.be/blaze/tutorial.html

I like to make a template function which captures common elements of pages in my web app, such as importing style sheets, external javascript files, menus, etc. For this tutorial we have a very simple template:

> template :: Text -> Html -> Response
> template title body = toResponse $
>   H.html $ do
>     H.head $ do
>       H.title (toHtml title)
>     H.body $ do
>       body
>       p $ a ! href "/" $ "back home"
>

We can then use that template like this:

> homePage :: ServerPart Response
> homePage =
>     ok $ template "home page" $ do
>            H.h1 "Hello!"
>            H.p "Writing applications with happstack-lite is fast and simple!"
>            H.p "Check out these killer apps."
>            H.p $ a ! href "/echo/secret%20message"  $ "echo"
>            H.p $ a ! href "/query?foo=bar" $ "query parameters"
>            H.p $ a ! href "/form"          $ "form processing"
>            H.p $ a ! href "/fortune"       $ "(fortune) cookies"
>            H.p $ a ! href "/files"         $ "file serving"
>            H.p $ a ! href "/upload"        $ "file uploads"

'ok' tells the server to return the page with the HTTP response code '200 OK'. There are other helper functions like 'notFound' and 'seeOther' for other response codes. Or use 'setResponseCode' to specify a response code by number.

The 'dir' function only matches on static path segments. If we have a dynamic path segment, we can use the 'path' function to capture the value and optionally convert it to another type such as Integer. In this example we just echo the captured path segment in the html. Trying visiting:

http://localhost:8000/echo/fantastic

> echo :: ServerPart Response
> echo =
>     path $ \(msg :: String) ->
>         ok $ template "echo" $ do 
>           p $ "echo says: " >> toHtml msg
>           p "Change the url to echo something else."

We can also extract values from the query string part of the URL. The
query string is the part that looks like "?foo=bar". Trying visiting:

http://localhost:8000/query?foo=bar

> queryParams :: ServerPart Response
> queryParams =
>     do mFoo <- optional $ lookText "foo"
>        ok $ template "query params" $ do
>          p $ "foo is set to: " >> toHtml (show mFoo)
>          p $ "change the url to set it to something else."

'lookText' will normally fail (by calling 'mzero') if the parameter is not found. In this example we used 'optional' from Control.Applicative so that it will return a 'Maybe' value instead.

We can use 'lookText' (and friends) to extract values from forms as well.

> formPage :: ServerPart Response
> formPage = msum [ viewForm, processForm ]
>   where
>     viewForm :: ServerPart Response
>     viewForm =
>         do method GET
>            ok $ template "form" $
>               form ! action "/form" ! enctype "multipart/form-data" ! A.method "POST" $ do
>                 label ! A.for "msg" $ "Say something clever"
>                 input ! type_ "text" ! A.id "msg" ! name "msg"
>                 input ! type_ "submit" ! value "Say it!"
>
>     processForm :: ServerPart Response
>     processForm =
>         do method POST
>            msg <- lookText "msg"
>            ok $ template "form" $ do
>              H.p "You said:"
>              H.p (toHtml msg)
>               

We can use the same 'lookText' function to look up values in in form data.

You will also note that we use the 'method' function to select between a 'GET' request and a 'POST' request. 

When the user first views the form, the browser will request "/form"
using the 'GET' method. In the form tag, we see that the form will
also be submitted to "/form" when the user presses the submit
button. But in the form tag we have set the method attribute to
'POST'.

> fortune :: ServerPart Response
> fortune = msum [ viewFortune, updateFortune ]
>     where
>       viewFortune :: ServerPart Response
>       viewFortune =
>           do method GET
>              mMemory <- optional $ lookCookieValue "fortune"
>              let memory = fromMaybe "Your future will be filled with web programming." mMemory
>              ok $ template "fortune" $ do 
>                     H.p "The message in your (fortune) cookie says:"
>                     H.p (toHtml memory)
>                     form ! action "/fortune" ! enctype "multipart/form-data" ! A.method "POST" $ do
>                     label ! A.for "fortune" $ "Change your fortune: "
>                     input ! type_ "text" ! A.id "fortune" ! name "new_fortune"
>                     input ! type_ "submit" ! value "Say it!"
>
>       updateFortune :: ServerPart Response
>       updateFortune =
>           do method POST
>              fortune <- lookText "new_fortune"
>              addCookies [(Session, mkCookie "fortune" (unpack fortune))]
>              seeOther ("/fortune" :: String) (toResponse ())

This example extends the form example to save the message in a cookie. That means you can navigate away from the page and when you come back later it will remember the message you saved.

There are only a few new things in this example compared to the form example.

 1. lookCookieValue works just like lookText, except it looks up cookies instead of request paramaters or form data.

 2. addCookies sends cookies to the browser. addCookies has the type:

     addCookies :: [(CookieLife, Cookie)] -> ServerPart ()

 3. 'CookieLife' specifies how long the cookie is valid. 'Session' means it is only valid until the browser window is closed.

 4. 'mkCookie' takes the cookie name and the cookie value and makes a Cookie.

 5. 'seeOther' does a 303 redirect tells the browser to do a new GET request on "/fortune".

In most web applications, we will want to serve static files from the
disk such as images, stylesheets, external javascript, etc. We can do
that using the serveDirectory function.

> fileServing :: ServerPart Response
> fileServing =
>     serveDirectory EnableBrowsing ["index.html"] "."

The first argument specifies whether serveDirectory should create directory listings or not.

The second argument is a list of index files. If the user requests a directory and the directory contains a index file (in this example "index.html"), then the server will display that index file instead of a directory listing.

The third argument is the path to the directory we want to serve files from. Here we serve files from the current directory.

On support platforms (Linux, OS X, Windows), the 'serveDirectory' function will automatically use sendfile() to serve the files. sendfile() uses low-level kernel operations to transfer files directly from the disk to the network with minimal CPU usage and maximal bandwidth usage.

Handling file uploads is very straight forward. We create a form, just as before. Except instead of 'lookText' we use 'lookFile'.

> upload :: ServerPart Response
> upload = 
>        msum [ uploadForm 
>             , handleUpload
>             ]
>     where
>     uploadForm :: ServerPart Response
>     uploadForm = 
>         do method GET
>            ok $ template "upload form" $ do
>              form ! enctype "multipart/form-data" ! A.method "POST" ! action "/upload" $ do
>                input ! type_ "file" ! name "file_upload" ! size "40"
>                input ! type_ "submit" ! value "upload"
>
>     handleUpload :: ServerPart Response
>     handleUpload = 
>         do (tmpFile, uploadName, contentType) <- lookFile "file_upload"
>            ok $ template "file uploaded" $ do
>                 p (toHtml $ "temporary file: " ++ tmpFile)
>                 p (toHtml $ "uploaded name:  " ++ uploadName)
>                 p (toHtml $ "content-type:   " ++ show contentType)

When a file is uploaded, we store it in a temporary location. The
temporary file will automatically be deleted after your request
handler finishes. That ensures that unused files don't clutter up the
disk. 

In most cases, you don't want a user to upload a file just to have it
deleted. Normally the upload handler would use 'moveFile' or
'copyFile' to move (or copy) the temporary file to a permanent location.
